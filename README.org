* gh-tracker

** Overview

  A simple project to play around with [[angularjs.org][angular.js]] while simultaneously
  exploring the language statistics, as derived from public [[http://github.com][github]]
  activity, of past and present [[http://theironyard.com][Iron Yard]] students.

** How it works

   Simply add repositories and associate them with tags to indicate
   things like location, cohort, course. We can then filter and
   receive both individual and aggregate language statistics after
   filtering by tags and time.
